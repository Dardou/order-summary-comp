## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass


### Continued development

I should focus on making better html markups before diving into css, having a better idea on padding/margin and how/why to use them, taking more time with the given design to analyse it deeply and therefore having an easier time reproducing it.

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - This helped me to have quick references to css properties.
